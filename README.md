Hi, I'm Kentravious, a self-taught web developer with a passion for creating clean, elegant designs and intuitive user experiences. I've been coding for a few years now, and have focused my efforts on mastering front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In my spare time, I love experimenting with new tools and frameworks, and I'm currently exploring the world of React and Next.js. I believe that learning should be a lifelong process, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills.

If you're looking for someone who's dedicated, creative, and enthusiastic about web development, look no further! Feel free to check out my portfolio and repositories to see some of my recent work.
